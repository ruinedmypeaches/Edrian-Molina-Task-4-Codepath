Dear John,

We appreciate your interest and enthusiasm for advancing your skills.

We understand that as a straight-A sophomore from MIT, you may feel ready for the Advanced track. However, our primary goal is to match each student with the track that will most effectively enhance their learning and development.

To give you an idea of the differences between the tracks, here are overview links for each course:

1. [Intermediate Track Overview](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip102/syllabus) 
2. [Advanced Track Overview](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip103/syllabus)

The Intermediate track covers the same initial topics as the Advanced track but at a more measured pace. For an instance, we sometimes cover a certain topic over multiple meetings.

In contrast, the Advanced track moves at a much faster pace, as we often tackle two topics in a single meeting.

Our commitment is to provide a learning environment where you can thrive, and we believe the Intermediate track will offer you the best opportunity to build a solid foundation and excel.

Please feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions or concerns. We look forward to seeing your progress and supporting you throughout the program.

Best regards,

Tim Lee
CodePath.org, Co-founder
