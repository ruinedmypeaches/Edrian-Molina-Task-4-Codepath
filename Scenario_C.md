Hi Anne,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in our Summer Interview Prep course. We truly appreciate your enthusiasm and dedication.

At the moment, our Summer Interview Prep course is full, and we have a long waitlist. The application deadline was two weeks ago, and unfortunately, we are unable to accommodate any more students this year. We understand how disappointing this must be, especially as you are graduating this Spring and won't be eligible to apply next year.

We know how challenging it can be to secure an internship, especially after applying to over 100 companies. We want to help you in any way we can, so we are sharing our high-level software interview guide, which contains tips and guidelines that you might find helpful as you continue your internship search.

Please check out our [high-level software interview guide](http://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguide) using this link.

Additionally, if you sign up for our mailing list, weâ€™ll notify you about any future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in.

We are continually working to make our programs accessible to as many people as possible and hope to bring more opportunities your way soon. Thank you for your understanding, and we wish you the best of luck in your job search.

All the best,
The CodePath.org Team
