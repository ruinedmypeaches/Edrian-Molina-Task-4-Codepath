Hi Jane,

Thank you for reaching out and for the tremendous effort you put into completing the Flix app. We truly appreciate your interest in our courses.

At the moment, our courses are specifically targeted at students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. We understand how frustrating it must be to hear this after dedicating over 10 hours to the application process. While our eligibility requirements are highlighted in multiple sections of our application form, we recognize that this can be easily overlooked amidst the excitement and effort of applying.

Please know that we have ambitions to expand our reach and already ran programs in other countries, such as Haiti and Taiwan. We plan to extend our programs to many more areas in the future. Your enthusiasm and dedication are exactly the qualities we look for in our students, and we hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon.

If you sign up for our mailing list, weâ€™ll notify you as classes become available in your area, powered by local organizers or through remote means. We sincerely hope to have the opportunity to welcome you into our programs in the near future.

Thank you for your understanding, and we wish you all the best in your continued learning.

All the best,
The CodePath.org Team
