Hey Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out to us. Although you have been removed from the **TIP101 (Intro to Technical Interview Prep)** class due to non-compliance with our course policy, you still have lifetime access to the course material using the GitHub account you used to sign up. We encourage you to continue utilizing these resources to further your skills.

As you know, complete and on-time assignment submission is core to our educational model! We only allow 1 late assignment per semester and even one missed assignment will result in removal from the course as outlined in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19).

We understand that circumstances can sometimes be challenging, and we appreciate your willingness to make up for the missed coursework. However, our policies are in place to ensure fairness and consistency for all students.

If there were extenuating circumstances that prevented you from completing your assignment on time, please provide us with more details. While we generally adhere strictly to our policies, we do review each case individually and take special circumstances into consideration.

Looking forward to your response.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
